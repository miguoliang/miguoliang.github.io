# A Letter from My Future Self Three Years Later

Dear Me from Three Years Ago,

Hello! I'm you from three years in the future. I'm writing this letter to tell you that the world three years from now is different from what we imagined, but overall it's moving in a positive direction. I want to share some important changes that I hope will inspire and give you confidence.

## 1. Financial Freedom Achieved

First, some good news: I've achieved financial freedom. Through three years of effort, my passive income now significantly exceeds my salary from three years ago, and it's very stable.

This is mainly due to several factors:
- Optimized investment portfolio: I've built a diversified portfolio including stocks, bonds, and some stable physical investments
- Side business monetization: Some of my previous hobby projects now generate stable cash flow
- Knowledge monetization: Through writing, consulting, etc., my professional knowledge continues to create value

Most importantly, I no longer work for money, but for interest and creating value. This shift in mindset has dramatically improved both my quality of life and work state.

## 2. Career Development: Becoming a Senior Leader

You might not expect this, but I'm still working. However, I'm now a senior leader in the company, mainly responsible for implementing company strategy.

My team covers various positions in R&D and operations. Interestingly, the team size is about one-third of what it was three years ago, reflecting how AI and automation have changed organizational structures. This role allows me to:
- Participate in major company decisions
- Drive technological innovation and business transformation
- Cultivate the next generation of technical and management talent

While the responsibility is greater, my perspective is also broader. Daily work is no longer about solving specific technical problems, but about thinking how to make the entire organization more efficient and creative.

## 3. AI Has Penetrated Every Aspect of Work

This is the biggest change. AI is no longer a concept, but has genuinely penetrated every aspect of work.

### Transformation of Coding Work
Now, most coding work can be done by AI. We just need to:
- Clearly describe requirements
- Set up architecture and standards
- Let AI generate code

Then we review and optimize. Development efficiency has increased by at least 3-5 times.

### Changes in Job Structure
There are far fewer people in basic operations and monitoring, R&D process management, QA, and similar roles. Most of this work has been taken over by automation tools and AI.

But those who remain are true experts. Their role is no longer to perform repetitive work, but to:
- Collaborate with AI in preliminary design
- Review AI-generated code to ensure quality and security
- Continuously optimize collaboration methods with AI
- Solve complex problems that AI cannot yet handle

### New Ways of Working
Our work now is more like being an "AI coach" or "AI collaboration expert." We need to:
- Learn how to clearly express requirements to AI
- Master how to evaluate the quality of AI output
- Understand AI's capability boundaries and know when human intervention is needed
- Continuously learn to keep up with AI technology development

## 4. Finally Have Time to Travel

I finally have time to travel. Now I take 3-4 spontaneous trips per year, traveling worldwide, giving myself high-quality relaxation, summarizing the past, and thinking about the future.

## 5. Three High-Quality Education Products

I have three high-quality operating products that fully reflect my independent value to human society, all focused on education. I believe that in the near future, the meaning of education will no longer be about knowledge intake and discovery, but more about fulfilling human interests or serving as an important means of finding existential meaning.

## Advice for Present You

Based on these three years of experience, I want to give you some advice:

1. **Don't Fear AI**: AI isn't here to replace us, but to enhance us. Start learning and using AI tools as soon as possible.

2. **Invest in Yourself**: The foundation of financial freedom is freedom of capability. Continuously learn and improve your professional skills and cognitive level.

3. **Build Multiple Income Streams**: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Start building your passive income system.

4. **Stay Curious**: Technology changes quickly. Maintaining curiosity about new things is essential to avoid being left behind by the times.

5. **Value Relationships**: No matter how technology changes, connections between people remain the most valuable.

The world three years from now is wonderful, but it requires preparation from present you. I believe in you, and I believe in us.

Looking forward to meeting you three years from now!

Best regards,

Future You
